### The Extrovert Ideal

Turn of the 20th century society moved away from the 'culture of character' where honour, morals and integrity were valued to the 'culture of personality' where being magnetic, fascinating, attractive and dominant is valued. 
Rise of capitialism, everything became about selling including the ability to sell yourself. Rather than certain roles needing these characterisitic, normal people became required to be extroverted to succeed. 
Adverts sell their products as the solution to become the extrovert ideal. 
Movie stars become the gold standard to aspire to. 
Even drugs are marketed to rid anxiety.
Schools and universities want 'well-rounded' students where getting good grades isn't enough, must also partake in many extra-curricular activities. 
Students who are shy or quiet become problematic. These two points I definetly can relate to. 

There is a sense that all these qualities which I feel I lack have just been imposed on me by society - the need to fit into the extrovert ideal mold. Now I'm feeling like maybe its OK not to want to do public speaking, maybe its OK not to do my upcoming talk. I felt pressure from myself to accept the offer because thats what successful people do and if I didn't do it I would be a failure.
