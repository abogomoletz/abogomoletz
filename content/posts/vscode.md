Coming from exclusively developing in the RStudio IDE (which is awesome!) it took a while to get used to vscode. This posts contains all my learnings from making that transition and tips to optimize productivity.  

# Keyboard shortcuts

To edit keyboard shortcuts run `ctrl + k ctrl + s`

This opens the keyboard shortcuts settings where you can search for a command and enter the keybinding. 


## Switching focus between terminal and active editor

I set these to match what I used in RStudio: `ctrl + 2` for the console and `ctrl + 1` for the editor.

`workbench.action.terminal.focus`   `ctrl + 2`

`workbench.action.focusActiveEditorGroup` `ctrl + 1`
